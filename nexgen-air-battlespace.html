          <p><em>NOTE: The non-factual content expressed in any part of this project represents personal opinions of the ACES Technology Team and does not represent an official statement on behalf of any organization.</em></p>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>The NexGen Air Battlespace project aims to provide an informative visualization of the complex network that constitutes modern air combat operations of the United States. 
          Many new technologies and platforms have been developed in recent years, with additional designs slated for release in the near future. This project seeks to highlight their individual capabilities 
          and the collective interactions that define modern air warfare.</p>

          <h2>Format</h2>
          <p>The data gathered will be presented in a strategic and organized manner. The primary format will be an online, three-dimensional interactive visualization, supplemented by detailed profile cards 
          providing further insights into individual systems. If feasible, a physical depiction of select models will also be created. This physical display may be featured at the ACES Technology Alpha Conference and possibly at other events.</p>

          <h2>An Invitation to the Defense Industry</h2>
          <p>As this project heavily relies on both descriptive and visual information, ensuring accuracy while respecting intellectual property rights is of utmost importance. 
          We invite members of the defense industry and military contractors to contribute any available information they wish to share. Three-dimensional models of designs, in particular, would be greatly appreciated. 
          These models do not need to be highly detailed—contractors can provide simplified representations that maintain confidentiality while still showcasing design principles.</p>

          <p>Participation in the NexGen Air Battlespace project benefits contractors by demonstrating how their designs integrate into the broader air combat network employed by the U.S. Armed Forces and the Department of Defense. 
          This project offers a public visualization of these technologies while also serving as a tool for collaboration between defense industry leaders and smaller firms. By participating, contractors can promote their innovations, 
          highlight the importance of their designs, and contribute to a comprehensive understanding of air combat advancements.</p>

          <h2>Content: What to Include</h2>
          <p>Not every aspect of combat aircraft, their capabilities, and their operational purposes can be included. Therefore, we have identified key areas of focus that are most relevant and beneficial:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>The future of combat aircraft: Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD), the Skyborg program, F/A-XX, and Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCAs).</li>
              <li>Strategic air conflicts and emerging threats, including Ukraine and Russia, Israel and Hamas, and China’s presence over the South China Sea.</li>
              <li>The role of Artificial Intelligence in modern combat: X-62A VISTA and the F-16 VENOM project.</li>
              <li>Innovative designs from private companies, such as Heron's Chimera engine and the Quarterhorse aircraft series.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Objects and Entities</h2>
          <p>The NexGen Air Battlespace will incorporate a range of key technologies, platforms, and entities that define modern aerial warfare:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA).</li>
              <li>Link 16 and other datalink communication systems.</li>
              <li>Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighters.</li>
              <li>The U.S. Navy's F/A-XX fighter(s).</li>
              <li>Low-cost platforms designed for scalable operations.</li>
              <li>Quarterhorse Mk 0 and Mk 1:
                  <p>Although not combat aircraft themselves, these designs represent critical advancements in transitioning from subsonic to supersonic and hypersonic speeds. 
                  Their development holds significant promise for future combat applications.</p>
              </li>
          </ul>
