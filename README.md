# ACES Technology

**ACES Technology** (Air Combat Engineering Systems Technology) is a student-led research and development initiative dedicated to exploring and analyzing cutting-edge advancements in military aerospace systems, with a focus on combat aircraft and their supporting technologies.

## Mission

Our mission is to bridge the gap between academic research, engineering education, and real-world defense innovation by:
- Investigating emerging technologies in air combat systems
- Building functional engineering prototypes and demos
- Hosting public conferences to promote open discourse
- Providing insights for engineers, defense professionals, and policy researchers

## Areas of Focus

- **Combat Aircraft Systems Analysis**: In-depth studies of programs like the F-35 Lightning II, Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD), and Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA)
- **Modularity & Embedded Systems**: Design and prototyping of plug-and-play sensor platforms that simulate advanced aircraft avionics
- **Visualization Projects**: Development of informative tools such as the NexGen Air Battlespace 2D visualization for emerging aerial platforms and strategic ecosystems
- **Sensor and Data Integration**: Real-time, embedded data acquisition systems powered by Arduino-based platforms for educational demonstrations

## Key Projects

### Purik Sensor System
A modular, low-cost sensor suite designed to demonstrate real-time embedded systems integration. Built using an Arduino Uno R4 WiFi, it includes:
- Radar-like ultrasonic scanning
- Environmental monitoring (temperature, humidity)
- Infrared proximity detection
- Web-based dashboard for live data visualization

### NexGen Air Battlespace
An interactive 2D visualization project showcasing current and near-future air combat platforms, strategic interactions, and emerging technologies from government and industry sources.

### ACES Tech Conferences
We have organized two major events:
- **ACES Tech ALPHA Conference**: Focused on new developments in combat aircraft technology, including analysis of F-35, NGAD, and CCA platforms
- **ACES Tech BETA Conference**: Highlights modularity, embedded systems, and cost-effective production strategies in defense engineering
